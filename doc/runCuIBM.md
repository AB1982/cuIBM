Once the installation completed, the cuIBM executable (`cuibm`) should be present in the sub-folder `bin` of the cuIBM directory.
To run a cuIBM simulation, navigate to the simulation directory (that contains all necessary input files) and call the executable.

    > export PATH="$CUIBM_DIR/bin:$PATH"
    > cd /path/to/simulation/folder
    > cuibm
